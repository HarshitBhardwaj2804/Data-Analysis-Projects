It is a Churn analysis project of an Telecom servics provider company(like airtel, jio). Churn refers to a customer who had left the company. So, in this project we are going analyze the data (tel_churn.csv). As it is a Data analysis project so here we will only do the descriptive analysis part. So for now our main goal is to find insights from the data about the person's to have churned. These insights will help to finding the patterns for the peoplpe who are more likey to churn. For the model building part to create a ML model which can predict that which customers are morelikely to churn in the near future, it is a part of predictive analysis or we can say part of Data Science. So we will do that part also but as a Data Science project.

**Approach for the project : **
1. Load our data(csv.file).
2. Take a overview of the data to understand it properly. It will include examine the no. of rows & columns of the data, dtypes of the columns, statistical measures of the numrical columns. 
3. Preforming data cleaning/data preprocessing.
         a. Detecting and handling the missing data.
4. Analysing.
         a. Univarite analysis.
         b. Bivariate analysis.
         c. Numerical analysis.
